Available NPCs to fight: Mayor Lewis, Pierre and Pam.

How it works:
- Use your Scythe or Golden Scythe near the NPCs (they will start to provoke you).
- To fight, use your tool on them (same of killing a monster).
- They will fly away. Good bye!
- Go to the Hospital to see the result.
- Each NPCs gives you a special loot :D
- Earn 1000g for the prank.
